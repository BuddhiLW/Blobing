# Syria 🇸🇾

## Dam massacre 2017

> The U.S. military bombed a massive Euphrates River dam in Syria in 2017 despite a military report warning such an attack could lead to a flood that would kill tens of thousands of civilians. That’s according to The New York Times, which reports the attack on the 18-story Tabqa Dam led to critical equipment failure, causing a reservoir to rise and prompting panicked evacuations downstream. At the time, the commander of the U.S. offensive dismissed reports that the U.S. was responsible as “crazy reporting.” In fact, the U.S. was responsible, and even selected at least one concrete-penetrating bunker-buster bomb for the attack. A follow-up U.S. airstrike reportedly killed three workers who rushed to the dam to prevent a disaster.

## Human Rights Violations

As the human rights violations of Palestinians by jew-european colonialists happens daily. Here is just a brief example of several international law violations thoughout the years.

Right to property: The Israeli government has been accused of land-grabbing and the forced removal of Palestinian families from their homes, which violates the right to property. For example, in 2018, Israel demolished over 40 homes in the West Bank settlement of Khan al-Ahmar, displacing an entire Bedouin community.^[1]^[2]^[3] Including the destruction of schools built with humanitarian-aid, by Belgium and Italy.^[2] 

```quote 
Any destruction of property by the occupying power is prohibited, except when rendered absolutely necessary by military operations, the UN says. The extensive demolition of property is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and may amount to a war crime, it adds. 
```

<!-- ## TODO -->
<!-- Right to adequate standard of living: The forced removal of Palestinians from their lands and properties can disrupt essential services such as healthcare, education, and access to food and water. For example, in 2016, Israel demolished a school in the West Bank settlement of Beit Hanoun, which served over 700 students.^[4] -->

<!-- Right to freedom of movement and residence: The forced removal of Palestinians from their homes and communities can violate the right to freedom of movement and residence. For example, in 2019, Israel demolished a Palestinian home in East Jerusalem, which displaced a family of six people who had lived there for over 50 years.^[5] -->

<!-- Right to non-discrimination: Apartheid is a form of discrimination that denies certain groups equal treatment under the law based on race or ethnicity. Israel has been accused of implementing an apartheid system in Palestine, which violates the right to non-discrimination. For example, in 2018, Israel passed the Nation-State Law, which legalized discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel and their families.^[6] -->

<!-- Right to cultural heritage: Land-grabbing often involves the destruction of communities and their cultural heritage, including historical sites, religious buildings, and traditional practices. For example, in 2017, Israel demolished a mosque in Jerusalem's Old City, which was built over 400 years ago.^[7] -->

<!-- Right to a fair trial: The forced removal of Palestinians from their lands and properties may involve legal proceedings that are unfair or biased against them. For example, in 2017, Israel passed the Regularization Law, which retroactively legalized settlements built on land that was confiscated from Palestinian owners.^[8] -->
