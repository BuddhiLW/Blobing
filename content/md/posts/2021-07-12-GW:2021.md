## I used to say, six years ago,

We had ten years to act - according to some estimates [1]. Folks and gals used to laugh at me, and say I was crazy. Well, that's what apocalyptic conditions looks like; and it's just the beginning. We are at ~1.5C average increase of climate [2]. At 2C, we are all doomed, being very gentle with the wording. Best predictions say we will very hopefully stop at 3C [3].

## Wait until there is no food at the shelves.

Yeah, soon you will be obliged to stop eating meat, also. I mean IF you don't want to die of ecocide.

## I have a great idea, alright?

Screw business and politics and let's give social-economical power to scientists whose forecasts are always above 95% precision level. Just stating the obvious. By the way, they offer actionable plans, different from politicians [4].
