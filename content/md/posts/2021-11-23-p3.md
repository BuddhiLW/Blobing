<p class="verse">
Sing me a song<br />
You always try me wrong.<br />
Wrong time, wrong rime.<br />
I can't afford for me,<br />
Such godness gracious<br />
Like yourself maliciously.<br />
<br />
Too much power spent<br />
In a wordly thing<br />
That has no end.<br />
Mixed messages, I think<br />
Are in the middle<br />
And in between.<br />
<br />
No greater sun could shine,<br />
Than out of this inspiration.<br />
Good god has blesses thee.<br />
Good god has blessed the frustration.<br />
We go forever, and beyond,<br />
Our philosophy will ever sound.<br />
