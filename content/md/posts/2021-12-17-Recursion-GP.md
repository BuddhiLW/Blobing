## This thought has come to me many times

### Cleaning analogy

When cleaning up something, like a room, we use objects which
themselves will get dirty. So, soon or later, we must clean the
cleaning objects themselves. In turn, we use other cleaning means, or
objects, like clean water. This water, soon or later, will be
treated, so to be cleaned. Etc.

The same can be said about a maid, for example. We use money to pay
someone to clean our house for us. This person, in turn, will have to
pay another person to clean their own, or clean themselves.

### Mapping the analogy to simple mathematics

Finally, this structure of things maps to the structure of `Geometric
Progressions` with decreasing terms. That is, the geometric ratio
being less than 1. Series with geometric ratios less than one will be
converging series. The sum total value of the infinite series given
by:

Let \\(\mathbf{a} = (a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots)\\), be terms of the
series. Let \\(r\\) be the `ratio` between two consecutive terms,
\\(r=\dfrac{a_{j+1}}{a_j}\\). Thus, the infinite sum is given by
\\(S_\{\infty\} = \dfrac{a_0}{1-r}\\).

### Case example, back to our analogy

So, let's say, in our analogy, that \\(\mathbf{a}\\) signifies the
consecutive efforts of each task. e.i., \\(a_0\\) is the effort to do the
first cleaning task. Therefore, if we simplify our `ratio` to a decreasing
average \\(|r|<1\\), we have that the \\(S_\{\infty\}\\) can be applied.

Thus, let \\(a_0=1\\) and \\(r=0.5\\), the total effort to clean, in the
entire chain of process is:  \\(S_\{\infty\} = \dfrac{1}{1-0.5} = 2\\). So,
the effort of all cleaning chain is twice the cleaning effort of the
first cleaning.

### Conclusion

Sometimes we just urge to write down our thoughts, doesn't matter how
simplistic or funny they may sound. That's one of those.
