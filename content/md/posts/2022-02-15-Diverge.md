# Panem et circenses
## Digressing into Divergence 
`Diversão` and `Divergir` both have the same root, which can be seen in `divest`, `diverge`. *Diversão* means to play or have fun. It&rsquo;s clear, in Portuguese, that to have fun watching fighting, or entertainment movies, etc. are but a symptom of diverging from the goals in life.
