* Climate-lag (BIO-CC)
Most species's life cycle are, at most, of [[https://tpwd.texas.gov/publications/nonpwdpubs/young_naturalist/animals/animal_life_spans/][30 years]]. When populations
go extinct, because of global change, it happens "all of a
sudden". Because one year you had them, the other less than half, in 5
years, none - their offspring didn't survive, so the cycle collapses.

That's one of the whys some climate crises conditions only appear
10-30 year later (the so-called climate-lag)[1,2].

** Fukushima
Fukushima, for example, consequences are still being studied. From
what we know, anyone who eats fish monthly, has "digested" radioative
food [3] (photo). Not enough, they decided to release the Fukushima
water they treated, saying it's safe to drink it - just as many have
said, let the politicians who say that take the first sip [4].

** Preferential futures:
- Remedy of biological collapses.
- Sustainable industrialization of underdevelopment countries.
- Share state-of-the-art technologies.
