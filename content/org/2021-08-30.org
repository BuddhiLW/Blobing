From a biological and medical standpoint: contact sports should be
banned, MMA, Boxing, American Football etc.

Unless, brain damage is accepted, "if one know the concequences". Just
like suicide. Everyone who chooses suicide knows the permanent brain
damage they will endure...

I rest my case. Btw, I practiced hardcore muay thai for 7 or more
years. I loved and love training. But, the truth hurts, literally. I
myself probably will endure the consequences of CTE (Chronic Traumatic
Encephalpathy). Even more so, because we know it evolves through time.

I come through this post saying this, because you may have loved ones
etc or yourself endure this. We should not look away, as I would be
dismissive back then. This is real an serious, we just have to have a
great look at this grim reality. We should morally not watch these
esports. This is the money-incentive that pushes remediation back,
from the scientific certainty
