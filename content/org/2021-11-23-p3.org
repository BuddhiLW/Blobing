Sing me a song
You always try me wrong.
Wrong time, wrong rime.
I can't afford for me,
Such godness gracious
Like yourself maliciously.

Too much power spent
In a wordly thing
That has no end.
Mixed messages, I think
Are in the middle
And in between.

No greater sun could shine,
Than out of this inspiration.
Good god has blesses thee.
Good god has blessed the frustration.
We go forever, and beyond,
Our philosophy will ever sound.
