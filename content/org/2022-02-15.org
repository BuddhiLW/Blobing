#+TITLE: Diverge (v.)

=Diversão= and =Divergir= both have the same root, which can be seen in =divest=, =diverge=. /Diversão/ means to play or have fun. It's clear, in Portuguese, that to have fun watching fighting, or entertainment movies, etc. are but a symptom of diverging from the goals in life.
