* Difficulties in maintaining parallel objectives

I have failed to not post here for a bit. I would love to spend periodic time to
make notes on this platform. Nothing necessarily special, just documenting my
life.

Often, I take notes of facebook conversations that I have; sometimes is a
political talk; sometimes it's alternative global systems, mathematics, general
semantics, physics et al. I wouldn't like to just waste this experience. Even
though my website in not necessarily popular, or an object attention in society,
like a gossip multinational enterprise, or some shit like that. So, It's not
that it's more likely to survive time, just that I would like to see them in
some place nice and organized.

Also, I would like to auto-critize my thinking while having conversations.
