* Multiple cursors mode
Multiple cursors rock! [fn:1][fn:2] And it works wonders with Evil Mode in Doom Emacs.

Just gotta activate it, in =.init.el=, by un-commenting "*multiple-cursors  ; editing in many places at once*".

Bam!, and read the docs. Using the =Describing the module= is also a big help, e.i., =doom/describe-module=.
